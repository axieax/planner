1. add a bit more frontend functionality
    - drag 'n drop as well as the way we have now
    - a way to remove courses
    - a way to override the prerequisites for a course (useful if you specifically have an exemption)
2. add more algorithms?
    - re-add the old anytime-solution algo
3. make the prereq parser more robust 
    - always can be done. None-ending task lol
4. add more testing
    - was hard to do previously as we were shifting api a lot
5. move to a database for courses?
    - I found it a bit cumbersome a task for not much gain, but it may have some benefits if we incorporate multiple years, etc.
